# Wireguard-Lite
Project to build Wireguard server on AWS Lightsail using Terraform

# Prerequisites
This project expects Terraform to be in your PATH and for Wireguard to already be installed. This project is not responsible for configuring your client machine but the config generated by this project could be taken to any other machine to connect to the Wireguard Server.


# Usage
## Create Server
Build the server and output your wg0-client.conf to your current directory.
`./deploy.sh`
## Destroy Server
Teardown the server and delete all files associated with build.
`./destroy.sh`

# Notes
This project is intented to be ephemeral in nature and does not use Terraform remote state. Keep track of your terraform.tfstate file to ease in the cleanup later.
